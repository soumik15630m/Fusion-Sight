"""WebRTC transport for live feeds -- the low-latency alternative to
/ws/track/{source_id}.

WebSockets run over TCP: one dropped packet stalls the whole connection until
it is retransmitted (head-of-line blocking), and every frame pays a
base64/JPEG encode-decode round trip. WebRTC carries video over UDP/SRTP --
a lost or late frame is simply skipped, which is exactly what a live AR
overlay wants (recency over completeness), and it lets the client
hardware-encode instead of shipping raw JPEGs.

Signaling here is a single HTTP POST (offer in, answer out); there is no
separate signaling server to run. The client should open its own data channel
labelled "detections" before creating its offer -- this endpoint also opens
one itself, so a client that skips that step still gets results on whichever
channel comes up. Detection JSON on that channel has the exact same shape as
the WebSocket path (app/schemas.py DetectionResponse): nothing about
app/detector.py changes, only how frames arrive and results leave.

/ws/track/{source_id} is untouched and keeps working -- this is an additional
transport, not a replacement, so existing clients need no changes.
